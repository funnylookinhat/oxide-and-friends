# Oxide and Friends: May 30th, 2023

## Open Source Governance

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from May 30th, 2023](https://youtu.be/16gT4nebygg).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
our special guest was
[Ashley Williams](https://mastodon.social/@ag_dubs).
We were also joined by
[Adam Jacob](https://mastodon.social/@adamhjk@hachyderm.io),
[Rachel Stephens](https://hachyderm.io/@rstephensme),
and [Jeremy Soller](https://mastodon.online/@soller@fosstodon.org).

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [Introspection Gaps | Rachel Stephens | Monktoberfest 2022](https://youtu.be/EaHs2tmiU9U) - Bryan referenced this talk given by [Rachel Stephens](https://hachyderm.io/@rstephensme) multiple times.
- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

Also of note:

- [The Rust I Wanted Had No Future](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/307291.html) - An interesting response to this Podcast from Graydon Hoare that was posted on 2024-06-04.

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
